# Aim Workshop

Aim Workshop is a game where you shoot targets and strive to achieve the highest score.

## Description

Built on the foundations of pygame, Aim Workshop is a fully functional and user-friendly mini-game.
The application includes several options to tailor the experience to the user's preference. 
Furthermore, the application includes a fully functional database using SQLite where the user
is able to see their past scores for each of the four game modes. 

Aim Workshop also includes modular classes for the sliders, buttons, and targets which can be used
in other pygame applications. These classes are fully modifiable for your liking.
